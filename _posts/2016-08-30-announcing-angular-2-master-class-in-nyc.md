We have also decided to encourage and inspire the next generation of developers... we think of this as a pay-forward investment to the future of Angular!

We encourage young minds to continue their exploration & skills development with the Angular 2 platform and web app technologies. 

Do you know a young teenager who has impressed you with their interest and beginner-skills in Web app development? Do you want to inspire them to continue their amazing journey with software development?

**For this training we will give away three (3) FREE tickets to our Angular 2 Master Class.** There simply is no better way to quickly ramp up on Angular 2. Just tweet why you think your nominee should get a ticket! Mention that person's twitter handle or email in the tweet. Include hashtag [#A2MC_YoungMinds](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23A2MC_YoungMinds).

Here's an example:

>> "I nominate @SomeOne because she's the youngest Angular Material contributor **#A2MC_YoungMinds**"

The nominee must be between at least 13 years old and younger than 18 years of age: high school students. And all candidates must be nominated by the Angular community.
